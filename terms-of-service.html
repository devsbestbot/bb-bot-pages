  <h1>ðŸ“œ Terms of Service</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> June 25, 2025</p>

  <p>By using this Discord bot (hereafter referred to as <strong>the Bot</strong>), you agree to the following terms. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, you should not use the Bot.</p>

  <h2>ðŸ”¹ 1. Use of the Bot</h2>
  <p>The Bot provides daily creative challenges on Discord servers where it is installed. Users can participate, react, and vote on entries. Use of the Bot must comply with Discordâ€™s <a href="https://discord.com/terms" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines" target="_blank">Community Guidelines</a>.</p>

  <h2>ðŸ”¹ 2. User Content</h2>
  <p>By submitting content (text, images, drawings, etc.) through the Botâ€™s challenges, you confirm that you have the rights to share that content and that it does not violate any laws or Discord policies.</p>
  <p>We do not claim ownership of your submissions, but by posting them, you grant permission for them to be displayed publicly within the server and included in leaderboards.</p>

  <h2>ðŸ”¹ 3. Data Handling</h2>
  <p>Participation data, votes, and user IDs are stored to support the Botâ€™s features (e.g. tracking entries, generating diverse challenges, maintaining scoreboards). For more details, please refer to the <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

  <h2>ðŸ”¹ 4. Prohibited Behavior</h2>
  <p>Users must not use the Bot to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Harass, bully, or threaten others</li>
    <li>Submit illegal, offensive, or NSFW content</li>
    <li>Exploit, abuse, or attempt to break the Bot</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Violating these rules may result in removal of your content, exclusion from leaderboards, or banning the Bot from your server.</p>

  <h2>ðŸ”¹ 5. Availability</h2>
  <p>The Bot is provided "as is", without any guarantee of uptime, functionality, or support. We may modify or discontinue the Bot at any time without notice.</p>

  <h2>ðŸ”¹ 6. Server Administrator Responsibility</h2>
  <p>By inviting the Bot, server administrators accept responsibility for its use on their server and for moderating any content generated by users through the Bot.</p>

  <h2>ðŸ”¹ 7. Changes to These Terms</h2>
  <p>These Terms of Service may be updated over time. If significant changes are made, a notice will be posted in servers using the Bot or on the linked website.</p>
